# Cornell API Client Libraries

Client Libraries for Cornell's public APIs implemented in different languages.

I would thank [Cornell Open Data Initiative](https://github.com/cornell-data)'s
documentation for APIs.

Check each sub-folder for more detail. Although those sub-folders contain a link
to their docs, you also need to read Cornell's
[API Spec](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/codi-admin/cornell-classes-api/) to
make sense of what's happening.
